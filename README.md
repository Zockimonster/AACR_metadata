Check of scAtlas metadata (https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-24-2183, https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article/31/4/756/751743/Human-Pancreatic-Cancer-Single-Cell-Atlas-Reveals): Code used to check the metadata in the scAtlas, with a coarse summary used to determine correct data vs. data for which conflicts were found. Details about conflicts can be found in the more detailed version below visualization of the coarse summary

To correct the metadata based on the Name column, the metadata_correction_based_on_Name_column file can be used, which requires downloading the functions stored in metadata_correction_functions in the data_dir, where the sc_Atlas.rds file can be loaded. The metadata will be extracted in the code, and is saved separately in the data_dir. Afterwards, the information available for each study is summarized in a table, and if correct, can be adjusted in the metadata by running the update_metadata_from_df() function.

At the end of the code, some tables, summarizing the adjusted information across all studies, based on the corrected metadata are returned, and the corrected metadata can be saved separately in the data_dir as updated_metadata_samn csv file, available to be added to the sc_Atlas.rds file.
